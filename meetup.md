## MEETUP DETAILS
### Introduction
 #Hacktoberfest Meetup started right on time :wink: with the **introduction** of the meetup participants. **Mr. Ahmad Awais'** sense of humor made the introduction of some participants enjoyable for every one and introduced himself in astonishing way to let the Pakistanis know that there are some people in Pakistan you should be proud of. Those were proud moments to know that Mr. Ahmad Awais has worked very hard to contribute in **Open Source Community** a lot and without any lust for money. That helped to encourage us to do so and follow his footsteps.
 ### A Brief History of the Git
 **Mr. Ahmad Awais** told about **Linus Torvalds** the creator of the **Git**. There were many funny aspects of his life that made topic interesting. The whole meetup was interactive. Mr Ahmad Awais started any new topic by asking a questions and then giving his **opinions** :laughing: :rofl: about every question and then elaborating in a way to relate the things to make it understandable to fit in the minds of even non technical people.
 ### Introduction of Git Version Control System and Getting Started Guide
 The starting point was [Github in 15 Minuets](http://www.try.github.com) , but Mr. Ahmad Awais explained basic Git command and working of the git version control by relating them with real world examples and comparing it with the problem scenarios faced by the people who don't know or don't want to use the version control system. Following is the summary:
 * Initializing a Git Directory
 * Add something in that repository
 * Check the status of the repository
 * Commit changes with a Message
 * Branches in git
 * Push from local Master branch to remote Master branch
 * Pull from remote Master branch to Local Master branch
 * Forking an open source project 
 * Cloning Forked Project
 * Creating a Pull Request for the open source Project
 * And some Professionalism in doing above activities (i.e how should be Commit Message)
 ### About  Hacktoberfest and Sponsors
 Benefits of participating in Hactoberfest, procedure to be a part of the #Hacktoberfest and efforts of the Sponsors like #GitHub and #DigitalOcean to bring the developers and  the open source community together, were described by Mr. Ahmad Awais in encouraging way.
 ### Question Answers
 As soon as the time was about to end, question Answer session started in which Mr. Ahmad Awais answered the queries of the participants.
 ### Refreshments
 Refreshments were given to all partipants which included :pizza: Pizza, Bottle ( and don't know the name but was tasty :sweat_smile: ).

## Feedback

* In my opinion this was a good step to conduct such interactive meetups to bring the like minded people at one place. It helps to share experiences and keeps up to date with the modern technology. We can learn and share knowledge to compete with developed countries and make our country an Advanced country. I think such meetups should be conducted twice or thrice in a month for different fields of interest. ‚Äì [Muhammad Adnan](github.com/AdnanMuhib)
* This event was realy informative motivational. I inspired a lot by the speaker behaviour and his sense of humour. I think this kind of should properly arranged on monthly basis this will a greate contribution from your side in national building. ‚Äì Muhammad Ramzan
* It was my first time to attend such kind of event, but it encouraged me to come up as open source contributer. The talk of **MR Ahmad Awais** was really impressive, communicative. The environment of the session was kinda Q/A session and it really helped a lot. ‚Äì [Muhammad Umair](github.com/mrumair)
* It was a good pushup for me to start working hard and start contributing to the open source. I'll try my level best to open source my all work. And try to motivate my other fellows to the same as well. ‚Äì @AliRaza1844
* Just like the previous meetup, this one too inspired me to start something new which this time was to contribute to open source.Another positive aspect I took away from this was to open source any of your work, for that way it carries great potential and helps in giving back and improving your skills. - Sudais Asif(github.com/sudaisasif)
