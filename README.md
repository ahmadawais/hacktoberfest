```
$ git branch -d <branch>
```

##### Rename current branch to new branch name
```shell
$ git branch -m <new_branch_name>
```

##### Force delete a local branch:
<em><sub>You will lose unmerged changes!</sub></em>

```
$ git branch -D <branch>
```

##### Mark the current commit with a tag:
```
$ git tag <tag-name>
```

##### Mark the current commit with a tag that includes a message:
```
$ git tag -a <tag-name>
```
<hr>

## Update & Publish

##### List all current configured remotes:
```
$ git remote -v
```

##### Show information about a remote:
```
$ git remote show <remote>
```

##### Add new remote repository, named &lt;remote&gt;:
```
$ git remote add <remote> <url>
```

##### Download all changes from &lt;remote&gt;, but don't integrate into HEAD:
```
$ git fetch <remote>
```

##### Download changes and directly merge/integrate into HEAD:
```
$ git remote pull <remote> <url>
```

##### Get all changes from HEAD to local repository:
```
$ git pull origin master
```

##### Get all changes from HEAD to local repository without a merge:
```
$ git pull --rebase <remote> <branch>
```

##### Publish local changes on a remote:
```
$ git push remote <remote> <branch>
```

##### Delete a branch on the remote:
```
$ git push <remote> :<branch> (since Git v1.5.0)
```
OR
```
$ git push <remote> --delete <branch> (since Git v1.7.0)
```

##### Publish your tags:

$ git push --tags
```
<hr>

#### Configure the merge tool globally to meld (editor)
```bash
$ git config --global merge.tool meld
```

##### Use your configured merge tool to solve conflicts:
```
$ git mergetool
```

## Merge & Rebase

##### Merge branch into your current HEAD:
```
$ git merge <branch>
```

##### Merge branch without fast forward (keeps the notion of explicit branches):
```
$ git merge --no-ff <branch>
```

##### Rebase your current HEAD onto &lt;branch&gt;:<br>
<em><sub>Don't rebase published commit!</sub></em>

```
$ git rebase <branch>
```

##### Abort a rebase:
```
$ git rebase --abort
```

##### Continue a rebase after resolving conflicts:
```
$ git rebase --continue
```

##### Use your editor to manually solve conflicts and (after resolving) mark file as resolved:
```
$ git add <resolved-file>
```

```
$ git rm <resolved-file>
```

##### Squashing commits:
```
$ git rebase -i <commit-just-before-first>
```

Now replace this,

```
pick <commit_id>
pick <commit_id2>
pick <commit_id3>
```

to this,

```
pick <commit_id>
squash <commit_id2>
squash <commit_id3>
```
<hr>

## Undo

##### Discard all local changes in your working directory:
```
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```

##### Get all the files out of the staging area(i.e. undo the last `git add`):
```
$ git reset HEAD
```

##### Discard local changes in a specific file:
```
$ git checkout HEAD <file>
```

##### Revert a commit (by producing a new commit with contrary changes):
```
$ git revert <commit>
```

##### Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and discard all changes since then:
```
$ git reset --hard <commit>
```

##### Reset your HEAD pointer to a remote branch current state.
```
$ git reset --hard <remote/branch> e.g., upstream/master, origin/my-feature
```

##### Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and preserve all changes as unstaged changes:
```
$ git reset <commit>
```

##### Reset your HEAD pointer to a previous commit and preserve uncommitted local changes:
```
$ git reset --keep <commit>
```

##### Remove files that were accidentally committed before they were added to .gitignore
```
$ git rm -r --cached .
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "remove xyz file"
```

## ⚡️ Git-Flow
Improved [Git-flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

* [Setup](#setup)
* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Features](#features)
* [Make a Release](#make-a-release)
* [Hotfixes](#hotfixes)
* [Commands](#commands)

<hr>

### Setup
###### You need a working git installation as prerequisite. Git flow works on OSX, Linux and Windows.

##### OSX Homebrew:
```
$ brew install git-flow-avh
```

##### OSX Macports:
```
$ port install git-flow
```

##### Linux (Debian-based):
```
$ sudo apt-get install git-flow
```

##### Windows (Cygwin):
###### You need wget and util-linux to install git-flow.
```bash
$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install <state> | bash
```
<hr>

### Getting Started
###### Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup. Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:
##### Initialize:
###### You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches. It's recommended to use the default values.
```shell
git flow init
```
OR
###### To use default
```shell
git flow init -d
```
<hr>

### Features
###### Develop new features for upcoming releases. Typically exist in developers repos only.
##### Start a new feature:
###### This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it.
```
git flow feature start MYFEATURE
```

##### Finish up a feature:
###### Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following:
###### 1) Merged MYFEATURE into 'develop'.
###### 2) Removes the feature branch.
###### 3) Switches back to 'develop' branch
```
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
```

##### Publish a feature:
###### Are you developing a feature in collaboration? Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.
```
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
```

##### Getting a published feature:
###### Get a feature published by another user.
```
git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
```

##### 10 Simple steps to contribute to any existing open source project on Github:
###### 1) First of all choose a project you want to contribute to.
###### 2) Go to the repository on Github page.
###### 3) Press the ‘fork’ button on the right side.
###### 4) Press the ‘Clone’ button to clone that project.
###### 5) Create a new branch and push it.
###### 6) Make all the changes on that new branch.
###### 7) Commit all the changes to that new and push them.
###### 8) Now go to that existing project and create a pull request by pressing the compare and pull request button.
###### 9) Congratulations your job is done :).
###### 10) Now the people maintaining that branch will review those changes and merge them.



##### Tracking a origin feature:
###### You can track a feature on origin by using
```
git flow feature track MYFEATURE
```
<hr>

### Make a Release
###### Support preparation of a new production release. Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release

##### Start a release:
###### To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch. You can optionally supply a [BASE] commit sha-1 hash to start the release from. The commit must be on the 'develop' branch.
```
git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]
```
###### It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:
```
git flow release publish RELEASE
```
###### (You can track a remote release with the: ```git flow release track RELEASE``` command)

##### Finish up a release:
###### Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:
###### 1) Merges the release branch back into 'master'
###### 2) Tags the release with its name
###### 3) Back-merges the release into 'develop'
###### 4) Removes the release branch
```
git flow release finish RELEASE
```
###### Don't forget to push your tags with ```git push --tags```

<hr>

### Hotfixes
###### Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

##### Git flow hotfix start:
###### Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with
```
$ git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]
```
###### The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

##### Finish a hotfix:
###### By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version
```
git flow hotfix finish VERSION
```
<hr>

## ⚡️ How to Contribute Here?
Make sure you follow the following simple set of rules here while trying to contribute.
- Every Pull Request must have a title.
- Every Pull Request must have a description.
- Write the title and description of what you have done in the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone.
    - ✅ **DO**: Start the line with "FIX", "ADD", "IMPROVE".
    - ❌ **DON'T**: Start with "Fixed", "Added", "Adding", "Improved".
    - 🎯 Read → [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end with a period.
- Have fun.
